# Accordion Framework Enhancement - Change Log 2

## Issue Fixed
**User Not Able to See Add Sections in Accordion Tab**

### Issue Description
Users were unable to access the "Add Section" functionality in the accordion properties panel, preventing them from adding new sections to accordions. This was a critical issue as it limited the primary functionality of the enhanced accordion framework.

### Root Cause
The AccordionProperties component was properly implemented but was missing from the PropertiesPanel component. Specifically:

1. The AccordionProperties component was not imported in the PropertiesPanel.tsx file
2. There was no conditional rendering for the AccordionControl type in the render function

### Fix Implementation
1. Added the import for AccordionProperties in PropertiesPanel.tsx:
```tsx
import AccordionProperties from './AccordionProperties';
```

2. Added conditional rendering for Accordion controls:
```tsx
{selectedControl.type === ControlType.Accordion && (
  <AccordionProperties
    control={selectedControl}
    onChange={updateSelectedControl}
  />
)}
```

### Verification
After implementing the fix, users can now:
- See the Add Section button in the accordion properties panel
- Successfully add new sections to accordions (up to the configured maximum)
- Configure and manage accordion sections as intended

### Impact
This fix restores the core functionality of the Accordion Framework Enhancement, allowing users to fully utilize the dynamic section management capabilities that were implemented in the previous update. Users can now add, remove, rename, and reorder sections as designed.

## Additional Notes
- No changes were required to the AccordionProperties component itself as it was correctly implemented
- The fix was isolated to the PropertiesPanel component, minimizing the risk of regression
- All accordion functionality remains compatible with the existing code base
