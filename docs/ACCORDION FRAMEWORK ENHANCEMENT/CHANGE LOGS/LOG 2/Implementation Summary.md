# Implementation Summary

## Fix Details

### Component Modified
- **PropertiesPanel.tsx**

### Changes Made
1. **Added Import Statement**
   ```tsx
   import AccordionProperties from './AccordionProperties';
   ```

2. **Added Conditional Rendering**
   ```tsx
   {selectedControl.type === ControlType.Accordion && (
     <AccordionProperties
       control={selectedControl}
       onChange={updateSelectedControl}
     />
   )}
   ```

### Testing Performed
- Verified that the accordion properties panel appears when an accordion control is selected
- Confirmed that sections can be added (up to the maximum limit)
- Validated that all accordion functionality works as expected, including:
  - Adding sections
  - Removing sections
  - Renaming sections
  - Reordering sections
  - Configuring section appearance

## Implementation Approach
The fix was implemented by analyzing the component structure and identifying the missing rendering condition in PropertiesPanel. The approach focused on minimal changes to ensure stability while resolving the issue.

## Code Quality Considerations
- **Maintainability**: The fix follows the existing pattern for rendering control-specific property editors
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript typing is maintained
- **Performance**: No performance impact as the change only affects control selection events

## Regression Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Added thorough documentation in this changelog
2. Ensured consistent patterns for property panel rendering
3. Updated testing procedures to specifically check for property panel visibility

## Next Steps
No further changes are needed for this specific issue, but we recommend:
1. Adding automated tests for properties panel rendering
2. Creating a properties panel registry to avoid missing component editors in the future
