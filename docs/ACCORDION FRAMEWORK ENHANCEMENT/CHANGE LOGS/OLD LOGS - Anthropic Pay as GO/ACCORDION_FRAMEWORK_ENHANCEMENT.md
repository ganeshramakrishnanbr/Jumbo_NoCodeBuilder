# Accordion Control Framework Enhancement

## Overview
The Accordion Control Framework has been enhanced to provide a more flexible and feature-rich experience for both designers and end-users. It now offers more configuration options, improved section management, and support for different layout modes.

## New Features

### 1. Dynamic Section Management
- **Add/Remove/Rename Sections**: Users can now add, remove, and rename accordion sections through the properties panel
- **Section Limit**: Configurable limit of sections (default: 1-3 sections)
- **Section Reordering**: Sections can be reordered using up/down controls
- **UI Feedback**: Visual feedback when reaching the maximum number of sections

### 2. Improved Rendering
- **Proper Control Nesting**: Controls within sections are now properly nested and rendered
- **Drag and Drop**: Enhanced drag-and-drop support for adding controls to specific sections
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear visual indicators when dragging over valid drop targets

### 3. Properties Panel Integration
- **Section Configuration**: Configure section appearance through the properties panel
- **Layout Options**: Switch between vertical and horizontal layouts
- **Section Styling**: Configure header style, content padding, and animation effects

### 4. Multiple Section Expansion
- **Toggle Mode**: Choose between single-section or multi-section expansion modes
- **State Persistence**: Expanded state is preserved across interactions
- **Animation**: Smooth animations when expanding/collapsing sections

### 5. Layout Options
- **Vertical Layout**: Traditional vertical stacking of accordion sections (default)
- **Horizontal Layout**: Side-by-side section display for better use of horizontal space
- **Responsive Behavior**: Proper display on different screen sizes

### 6. Design-Time vs. Preview Mode
- **Design-Time Features**: Additional controls visible during design mode
- **Preview Mode**: Clean representation of the accordion as it will appear to end-users
- **Context-Aware Behavior**: Different behavior based on whether in design or preview mode

## Implementation Details

### API Changes
The `AccordionControl` interface has been extended with new properties:

```typescript
export interface AccordionControl extends Control {
  type: ControlType.Accordion;
  sections: AccordionSection[];
  expandedSections?: string[];
  layout: 'vertical' | 'horizontal';
  maxSections: number;
  allowMultipleExpanded?: boolean;
  sectionConfiguration?: {
    minHeight?: string;
    headerStyle?: 'default' | 'bordered' | 'gradient';
    contentPadding?: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
    animationDuration?: number;
  };
}
```

### Technical Improvements
1. **Performance Optimization**: Tracked and optimized performance for section operations
2. **Type Safety**: Improved TypeScript type definitions for better developer experience
3. **Event Delegation**: Proper event handling for nested controls
4. **State Management**: Better state management for accordion sections
5. **Accessibility**: Enhanced keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes

## Usage
The enhanced accordion control can be configured through the Properties Panel when an accordion is selected:

1. **Section Management**: Add, remove, or rename sections
2. **Layout Mode**: Select either vertical or horizontal layout
3. **Expansion Behavior**: Configure whether multiple sections can be expanded simultaneously
4. **Appearance**: Customize header style, content padding, and animation effects

## Developer Extensions
The framework is designed to be extensible for future enhancements:
- Custom section templates could be implemented in future updates
- Additional styling options can be added to the sectionConfiguration object
- The animation system can be expanded to support different transition effects
