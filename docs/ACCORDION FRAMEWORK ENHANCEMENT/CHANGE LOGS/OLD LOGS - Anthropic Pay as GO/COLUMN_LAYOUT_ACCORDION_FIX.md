# Column Layout in Accordion Fix

## Problem Description

Two issues were identified and fixed in the questionnaire designer:

1. **Missing Key Prop in PreviewTab**: React was showing warnings about lists rendered without unique key props in the PreviewTab component.

2. **Excessive Drag-Over Logging**: The CanvasControl component was generating excessive console logs during drag-over events, particularly when placing ColumnLayout controls inside Accordion sections.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Missing Key Prop Fix

Added the required `key` prop to list rendering in two locations in `PreviewTab.tsx`:

- In the main questionnaire controls rendering:
```jsx
{questionnaire.controls.map((control) => (
  <div key={control.id}>
    {renderControl(control)}
  </div>
))}
```

- In the column layout rendering:
```jsx
{column.map((control) => (
  <div key={control.id}>
    {renderControl(control)}
  </div>
))}
```

### 2. Excessive Drag-Over Logging Fix

Implemented a throttling mechanism in the CanvasControl component that:

- Tracks the last logged drag event with a React ref
- Only logs events if they are different or after a time threshold (1 second)
- Provides improved visual feedback during drag operations
- Preserves critical logging for important operations like ColumnLayout to Accordion drops

### 3. ColumnLayout in Accordion Issue

Enhanced the handling of ColumnLayout controls in Accordion sections:

- Improved initialization of ColumnLayout controls to ensure proper structure
- Added validation to ensure column arrays are properly initialized
- Enhanced deep cloning of ColumnLayout objects when moving them to Accordion sections
- Added defensive checks to detect and handle malformed column layouts
- Added visual feedback to indicate when a ColumnLayout is dragged over an Accordion section

## Technical Details

### Throttling Implementation

```jsx
// Track last logged drag event to prevent excessive logging
const lastDragEventRef = React.useRef<{targetType: string, controlType: string, timestamp: number} | null>(null);

// Only log if necessary conditions are met
const shouldLog = 
  !lastEvent || 
  now - lastEvent.timestamp > 1000 || 
  lastEvent.targetType !== targetType || 
  lastEvent.controlType !== draggedItem.controlType ||
  isSpecialCase;
```

### ColumnLayout Validation

Added validation for ColumnLayout controls to ensure they have properly initialized columnControls arrays:

```jsx
// Ensure the columnControls property is properly initialized as a valid array of arrays
if (!Array.isArray(newControl.columnControls) || newControl.columnControls.length !== 2) {
  console.log('[CanvasControl] Ensuring proper columnControls initialization');
  (newControl as ColumnLayoutControl).columnControls = [[], []];
}

// Verify and fix any column arrays that aren't initialized as arrays
(newControl as ColumnLayoutControl).columnControls = 
  (newControl as ColumnLayoutControl).columnControls.map(col => 
    Array.isArray(col) ? col : []
  );
```

## Testing Notes

The fixes have been tested with the following scenarios:

1. Creating and dragging new ColumnLayout controls into accordion sections
2. Moving existing ColumnLayout controls into accordion sections
3. Checking the React dev tools for any key prop warnings
4. Monitoring the console for excessive logs during drag operations

All scenarios now work correctly with proper UI feedback and optimized logging.
