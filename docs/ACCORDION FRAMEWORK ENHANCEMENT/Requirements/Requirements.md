Accordion Control Feature Framework
CONTEXT
System: UI Designer/Builder application with accordion container control functionality
Existing Components:

Accordion control (container component with expandable/collapsible sections)
Design Tab (editing/configuration interface)
Preview Tab (runtime simulation interface)
Properties panel (displays control-specific configurations)
Drag-and-drop system for control placement
Section management system

Current Architecture Issues:

Control rendering pipeline fails within accordion sections
Properties panel event binding not working for nested controls
Section management limited to default single section

Requirements:

Dynamic section management (add, remove, rename) with 1-3 section limit
Proper control rendering within sections
Properties panel integration for nested controls
Layout options (vertical/horizontal)
Multi-section expansion capability

TASK
Implement a fully functional accordion control system that allows users to:

Dynamically manage sections (add up to 3, remove while maintaining 1 minimum, rename)
Drag and drop controls into sections with proper rendering
Access control properties when clicking nested controls
Configure layout orientation (vertical/horizontal)
Expand/collapse multiple sections simultaneously
Maintain design-time functionality that's hidden in preview mode

CONSTRAINTS

Performance: Efficient rendering of nested controls without layout thrashing
Memory: Proper cleanup of removed sections and their contained controls
User Experience: Smooth drag-and-drop interactions, immediate property panel updates
Validation: Enforce 1-3 section limits, prevent deletion of last section
Accessibility: Keyboard navigation support, screen reader compatibility
Browser Compatibility: Cross-browser support for drag-and-drop APIs

OUTPUT
Primary Deliverables:

"Add Section" Button: Visible only in design tab, allows adding up to 3 sections
Default Section: One section present by default in design tab
Section Management: Add up to 3 sections in same row configuration
Control Properties Access: Clicking nested controls displays their properties
Proper Control Rendering: All controls within sections render correctly
Section Renaming: Double-click or right-click context menu to rename sections
Section Removal: Delete button with confirmation (maintain minimum 1 section)
Drag-and-Drop Zones: Visual indicators when dragging controls over sections
Layout Toggle: UI control to switch between vertical/horizontal section layouts
Multi-Section Expansion: Allow all sections to be expanded simultaneously
Section State Persistence: Remember expanded/collapsed state during design session

Technical Implementation Outputs:

Event Delegation System: Handle clicks on dynamically added controls
Render Pipeline: Proper component lifecycle for nested controls
Property Panel Integration: Bidirectional binding between controls and properties
Validation System: Enforce section limits and prevent invalid operations

Review Section:
Quality Assurance Checklist:

 Accordion renders correctly in both design and preview tabs
 All nested controls display properties when selected
 Section management (add/remove/rename) works within constraints
 Drag-and-drop functionality is smooth and reliable
 Layout switching (vertical/horizontal) works correctly
 Multiple sections can be expanded simultaneously
 No memory leaks when adding/removing sections
 Accessibility features are implemented
 Cross-browser compatibility verified
 Performance benchmarks meet requirements
 Unit tests cover all major functionality

IMPORTANT NOTES
File Modification Scope: Implementation should only modify the necessary files directly related to accordion control functionality. Do not make changes to:

Existing core system files unless absolutely necessary for integration
Other control implementations or components
Global configuration files outside of accordion-specific settings
Shared utility functions unless required for accordion functionality

Impact Limitation: Changes should be contained within the accordion control ecosystem to minimize risk of breaking existing functionality and to maintain system stability.

Success Metrics

Functional: All accordion features working correctly (add/remove/rename sections, control rendering, properties access)
Performance: Section operations complete within 100ms, no layout thrashing during drag-and-drop
Reliability: 100% success rate for control property access within sections
Usability: Intuitive drag-and-drop with clear visual feedback, seamless section management
Compatibility: Works across all supported browsers and integrates with existing control ecosystem
Maintainability: Clean architecture supporting easy addition of new section features
