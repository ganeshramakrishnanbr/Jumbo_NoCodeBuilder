## Date: May 21, 2025

### Files Modified:
- `src/components/designer/canvas/CanvasControl.tsx`

### Issues Fixed:

#### 1. Horizontal Layout Drag and Drop Issue
- Fixed the inability to place controls in Section 2 and Section 3 when using the horizontal layout mode
- Added explicit event handling for all accordion sections
- Improved event propagation in the horizontal layout
- Enhanced drop zone handling with better z-index and positioning
- Added explicit event prevention to ensure proper drag and drop behavior

#### 2. Required Field Indicator Display Issue
- Added the required field indicator (red asterisk) to display next to the Accordion control label when marked as required
- Implemented conditional rendering logic to show the indicator only when the control is marked as required
- Applied consistent styling with other required controls

### Implementation Details:

#### Changes for Horizontal Layout Fix:
- Added data attributes to help with layout-specific behavior
- Enhanced accordion section container with proper z-index and positioning
- Improved event handlers with explicit preventDefault() and stopPropagation()
- Added style properties to section containers to ensure proper interaction in both layouts
- Enhanced drop zone event handling for sections with no controls
- Improved CSS flex container structure for better event capture and bubbling
- Added comprehensive debug logging to identify and fix event handling issues
- Increased drop target size and visibility for better drag and drop operations
- Applied proper pointer-events CSS to ensure interactive elements work correctly
- Enhanced horizontal layout container with better sizing and relative positioning
- Implemented layout-specific styling with data attributes for targeted CSS

#### Changes for Required Field Indicator:
- Added conditional rendering for the required field indicator in the main control header
- Used consistent styling with other controls (text-red-500 class)
- Placed the indicator immediately after the control label

### Testing:
- Verified controls can be dragged and dropped into all sections in horizontal layout
- Confirmed the required indicator appears when the Accordion control is marked as required
- Tested in multiple browsers to ensure consistent behavior

### Next Steps:
- Continue monitoring for edge cases in horizontal layout behavior
- Consider adding tests to ensure drag and drop functionality remains working in future updates
