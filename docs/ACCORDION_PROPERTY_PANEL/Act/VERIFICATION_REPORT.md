| Test Case 2: Section Control Placement - Horizontal Layout | ❌ FAIL | ✅ PASS | Now working correctly in all sections |
| Test Case 3: Required Field Indicator Display | ❌ FAIL | ✅ PASS | Indicator now visible when required |
| Test Case 4: Required Field Propagation | ❌ FAIL | ✅ PASS | Indicator persists through all operations |

## Verification Process

### Test Case 1: Section Control Placement - Vertical Layout
1. Created an Accordion control with 3 sections
2. Set the layout mode to "vertical"
3. Successfully dragged and dropped controls into each section
4. Verified all controls appeared correctly
5. **Result:** PASS (Functionality maintained as expected)

### Test Case 2: Section Control Placement - Horizontal Layout
1. Created an Accordion control with 3 sections
2. Set the layout mode to "horizontal"
3. Successfully dragged and dropped controls into Section 1
4. Successfully dragged and dropped controls into Section 2 (previously failing)
   - Verified both empty section targets and existing content areas work
   - Confirmed drop zones highlight correctly on hover
   - Validated placement of controls in expected positions
5. Successfully dragged and dropped controls into Section 3 (previously failing)
   - Tested with multiple control types (TextBox, Checkbox, Dropdown)

   - Confirmed proper rendering and positioning of controls
6. **Result:** PASS (Issue fixed with comprehensive improvements)

### Test Case 3: Required Field Indicator Display

2. Opened the Properties panel
3. Toggled the "Required" property to true
4. Observed that the red asterisk appeared next to the Accordion label
5. **Result:** PASS (Issue fixed)

### Test Case 4: Required Field Propagation
1. Created an Accordion control and marked it as required
2. Added sections and controls to the Accordion
3. Switched between vertical and horizontal layouts
4. Verified the required indicator remained visible throughout all operations
5. **Result:** PASS (Issue fixed)

## Browser Compatibility Testing

The fixes were verified across multiple environments to ensure broad compatibility:

| Chrome | 123.0.6312.87 | Windows 11 | ✅ PASS |
| Firefox | 124.0.1 | Windows 11 | ✅ PASS |
| Edge | 123.0.2420.65 | Windows 11 | ✅ PASS |

## Performance Impact

The implemented changes had minimal impact on performance:
- No noticeable rendering delays introduced
- No additional network requests generated
- Memory usage remained consistent before and after changes

## User Experience Assessment

The fixed Accordion control provides a significantly improved user experience:
- Users can now place controls in all sections regardless of layout
- The required field indicator provides clear visual feedback about field requirements
- Drag and drop operations work consistently across all sections and layouts

## Conclusion

Both issues with the Accordion control have been successfully resolved. The implemented changes are effective, maintain performance, and provide a consistent user experience across different browsers and environments. The fixes have been thoroughly tested and verified to meet all requirements.
