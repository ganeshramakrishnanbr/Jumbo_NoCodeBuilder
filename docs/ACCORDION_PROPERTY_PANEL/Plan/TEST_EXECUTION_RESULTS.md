# Accordion Control T### Test Case 2: Section Control Placement - Horizontal Layout
- **Status:** FAIL
- **Observations:** 
  - Controls can be placed in Section 1 without issues
  - Sections 2 and 3 don't seem to receive drag events correctly
  - No visual feedback appears when hovering over drop zones in Sections 2 and 3
  - Console shows no errors, suggesting event handlers aren't being triggered at all
  - Issue appears to be related to:
    - CSS flex layout issues in horizontal mode preventing event propagation
    - Incorrect z-index and positioning in the nested structure
    - Insufficient drop target areas for proper interaction
    - Missing event handling for specific layout scenariosution Results

## Test Execution Summary

| Test Case | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Test Case 1: Section Control Placement - Vertical Layout | ✅ PASS | Controls can be placed in all sections in vertical layout |
| Test Case 2: Section Control Placement - Horizontal Layout | ❌ FAIL | Controls cannot be placed in Section 2 and 3 in horizontal layout |
| Test Case 3: Required Field Indicator Display | ❌ FAIL | Required field indicator doesn't appear for Accordion control |
| Test Case 4: Required Field Propagation | ❌ FAIL | Required state not visually indicated during transitions |

## Detailed Test Results

### Test Case 1: Section Control Placement - Vertical Layout
- **Status:** PASS
- **Observations:** 
  - Controls can be dragged and dropped into all three sections without issues
  - Event handlers work correctly for all sections
  - Visual feedback is provided during drag operations
  - Controls appear correctly after dropping

### Test Case 2: Section Control Placement - Horizontal Layout
- **Status:** FAIL
- **Observations:**
  - Controls can be placed in Section 1 without issues
  - Sections 2 and 3 don't seem to receive drag events correctly
  - No visual feedback appears when hovering over drop zones in Sections 2 and 3
  - Console shows no errors, suggesting event handlers aren't being triggered at all
  - Issue appears to be related to event binding or CSS layout issues in horizontal mode

### Test Case 3: Required Field Indicator Display
- **Status:** FAIL
- **Observations:**
  - Toggling the "Required" property in the Properties panel successfully updates the control's state
  - Required flag is correctly stored in the control's data structure
  - The red asterisk indicator doesn't appear next to the Accordion label
  - The rendering logic for the header component doesn't include the required indicator

### Test Case 4: Required Field Propagation
- **Status:** FAIL
- **Observations:**
  - Required state is maintained in the control's data structure during layout changes
  - Visual indicator is missing throughout all states and operations
  - The issue is consistent across all section configurations

## Root Cause Analysis

### Horizontal Layout Issue
- The drop event handlers in the horizontal layout aren't receiving events properly
- In the horizontal layout, the CSS layout uses flex containers differently than in vertical mode
- Event propagation may be blocked by container elements with non-interactive CSS properties
- The drag event might not be reaching the drop target due to z-index or overflow issues

### Required Field Indicator Issue
- The Accordion control header rendering doesn't include the required field indicator logic
- Unlike other controls where the label and required indicator are rendered together, the Accordion has a different rendering approach
- The conditional logic to show the indicator exists but isn't implemented in the Accordion header component

## Test Environment
- Browser: Chrome 123.0.6312.87
- OS: Windows 11
- Screen resolution: 1920x1080
- React DevTools and Chrome DevTools were used for debugging

## Conclusion
Two distinct issues need to be fixed:
1. The event handling and CSS structure for horizontal Accordion layouts
2. The rendering logic for the required field indicator in Accordion headers

These issues are independent and can be fixed separately, but both are critical for proper functionality of the Accordion control.
