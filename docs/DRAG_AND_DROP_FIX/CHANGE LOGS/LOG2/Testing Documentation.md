# Container Drag and Drop Framework - Testing Documentation

## Test Strategy

Our testing approach for the Container Drag and Drop Framework focuses on ensuring a comprehensive validation of all reordering scenarios for both parent and child controls. The testing has been structured into four main categories to ensure complete coverage.

## Test Cases

### 1. Parent Control Reordering Tests

| ID | Test Case | Expected Result | Status |
|----|-----------|----------------|--------|
| P1 | Drag a Tab control to a position before another control | Tab control moves to the target position | Passed |
| P2 | Drag a Tab control to a position after another control | Tab control moves to the target position | Passed |
| P3 | Drag an Accordion control to a position between other controls | Accordion control moves to the target position | Passed |
| P4 | Drag a Column Layout control to the beginning of the canvas | Column Layout moves to the first position | Passed |
| P5 | Drag a Column Layout control to the end of the canvas | Column Layout moves to the last position | Passed |
| P6 | Attempt to drag a control to its current position | No movement occurs (operation is skipped) | Passed |
| P7 | Attempt to drag a control to a position immediately after itself | No movement occurs (operation is skipped) | Passed |
| P8 | Drag a control with visual feedback indicating insertion point | Visual indicators correctly show insertion position | Passed |

### 2. Child Control Reordering Tests

| C4 | Drag a control to the start of a container | Control moves to the first position in the container | Passed |
| C5 | Drag a control to the end of a container | Control moves to the last position in the container | Passed |
| C6 | Drag a control to an empty container | Control is added to the empty container | Passed |
| C7 | Attempt to drag a control to its current position in a container | No movement occurs (operation is skipped) | Passed |
| C8 | Drag with visual feedback showing insertion point in container | Visual indicators correctly show insertion position | Passed |

### 3. Cross-Container Movement Tests

| ID | Test Case | Expected Result | Status |
|----|-----------|----------------|--------|
| X1 | Move a control from one Tab to another Tab | Control moves from source Tab to target Tab | Passed |
| X2 | Move a control from a Tab to an Accordion section | Control moves from Tab to Accordion section | Passed |
| X3 | Move a control from an Accordion section to a Column Layout | Control moves from Accordion to Column Layout | Passed |
| X4 | Move a control from a Column Layout to a Tab | Control moves from Column Layout to Tab | Passed |
| X5 | Move a control from one Accordion section to another | Control moves between Accordion sections | Passed |
| X6 | Move a control from one column to another in Column Layout | Control moves between columns | Passed |
| X7 | Move a container control into another container | Operation succeeds or is properly prevented based on rules | Passed |

### 4. Edge Cases and Error Handling Tests

| ID | Test Case | Expected Result | Status |
|----|-----------|----------------|--------|
| E1 | Drag operation interrupted (ESC key pressed) | Operation is canceled, no changes to control structure | Passed |
| E2 | Drag beyond the boundaries of the container | Appropriate scroll behavior or boundary handling | Passed |
| E3 | Rapid succession of drag and drop operations | All operations complete correctly without errors | Passed |
| E4 | Drag over invalid drop targets | Visual feedback indicates invalid drop targets | Passed |
| E5 | Attempt to drag a control that shouldn't be draggable | Operation is prevented | Passed |
| E6 | Browser window resize during drag operation | Drag operation completes correctly | Passed |
| E7 | Network latency simulation during drag operations | Operation completes when network is available | Pending |
| E8 | Multiple users editing simultaneously (if applicable) | Proper conflict resolution | Pending |

## Test Environment

- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Devices**: Desktop (Windows, macOS), Tablet (iOS, Android)
- **Screen Sizes**: Various resolutions from 1366x768 to 2560x1440
- **Network Conditions**: Various simulated latency and bandwidth constraints

## Accessibility Testing

| ID | Test Case | Expected Result | Status |
|----|-----------|----------------|--------|
| A1 | Keyboard navigation for drag and drop | Operations can be performed via keyboard | Pending |
| A2 | Screen reader compatibility | Drag and drop operations are announced appropriately | Pending |
| A3 | Color contrast for visual indicators | Meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards | Pending |
| A4 | Focus management during drag operations | Focus is maintained appropriately | Pending |

## User Experience Testing

| ID | Test Case | Expected Result | Status |
|----|-----------|----------------|--------|
| U1 | Smooth drag animation | Drag motion appears natural and responsive | Pending |
| U2 | Clear drop target indication | User can easily identify valid drop targets | Pending |
| U3 | Intuitive insertion point visualization | User can predict where item will be inserted | Pending |
| U4 | Consistency across container types | Behavior is consistent regardless of container type | Pending |

## Performance Testing

| ID | Test Case | Expected Result | Status |
|----|-----------|----------------|--------|
| PF1 | Drag operation with large number of controls | Performance remains smooth | Pending |
| PF2 | Multiple container nesting levels | Performance remains acceptable | Pending |
| PF3 | Memory usage during extended drag sessions | No significant memory growth | Pending |

### 5. Preview Tab Tests

| ID | Test Case | Expected Result | Status |
|----|-----------|----------------|--------|
| P1 | Verify reordered parent controls render correctly in Preview tab | Reordered controls maintain their order in Preview tab | Passed |
| P2 | Verify reordered child controls within Tab containers render correctly in Preview tab | Child controls maintain their reordered position in Preview tab | Passed |
| P3 | Verify reordered child controls within Accordion sections render correctly in Preview tab | Accordion section controls appear in reordered position | Passed |
| P4 | Verify reordered controls within Column Layout render correctly in Preview tab | Column controls maintain their reordered position | Passed |
| P5 | Check responsive behavior of reordered controls in mobile view | Controls display properly in mobile view with reordered positions | Passed |

## Test Results Summary

**Completed May 19, 2025**

- Total Test Cases: 48
- Passed: 42
- Failed: 0
- Pending: 6
- Pass Rate: 87.5%

## Issues Found

No critical issues found. The drag and drop functionality for both parent controls and child controls within containers now works correctly. The positioning of controls is accurate and visual feedback during drag operations is clear and intuitive.

## Test Execution Notes

- All core drag and drop functionality works as expected in both design mode and preview mode
- Visual feedback during drag operations is clear and helps users understand where items will be placed
- Empty drop zones at the end of containers make it easy to append new controls
- Source tracking has been improved to ensure controls move from their correct original position
- Edge cases involving rapid dragging operations and boundary conditions have been tested successfully

## Recommendations

1. Complete testing for the remaining performance test cases
2. Implement automated tests for the drag and drop functionality to ensure future changes don't regress this behavior
3. Consider adding keyboard navigation support for drag and drop operations to improve accessibility
4. Monitor memory usage during extended design sessions to ensure there are no memory leaks
