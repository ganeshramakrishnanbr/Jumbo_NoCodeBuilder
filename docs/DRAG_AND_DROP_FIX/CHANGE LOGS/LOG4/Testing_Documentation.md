# Testing Documentation - LOG4 Fix

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing approach for the LOG4 drag-and-drop fixes. It combines test cases from previous logs (LOG1, LOG2, LOG3) with new test cases specific to the identified issues.

## Test Environment

- **Browser**: Chrome 125.0.6422.112
- **React Dev Tools**: Enabled for component inspection
- **Console**: Open for viewing debug logs
- **Application URL**: http://localhost:5175/
- **Test Date**: May 20, 2025
- **Tester**: QA Engineer

## Test Categories

### 1. Basic Drag and Drop Tests (from LOG1, LOG2)

| ID | Test Case | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|----|-----------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| BD1 | Drag a regular control (TextBox) from palette to canvas | Control added to canvas | Control added successfully to canvas | ✅ |
| BD2 | Drag a second TextBox control below the first one | Controls ordered correctly | Controls ordered correctly | ✅ |
| BD3 | Drag the second control above the first one | Order should be swapped | Order swapped correctly | ✅ |
| BD4 | Drag a control from position 3 to position 1 | Control should move to first position | Control moved to position 1 | ✅ |
| BD5 | Drag a control to the same position | No change should occur | No change occurred | ✅ |

### 2. Container Control Tests (from LOG2, LOG3)

| ID | Test Case | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|----|-----------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| CC1 | Drag a Tab control to canvas | Tab control added to canvas | Tab control added to canvas | ✅ |
| CC2 | Drag a ColumnLayout control below the Tab control | ColumnLayout appears below Tab | ColumnLayout appeared below Tab | ✅ |
| CC3 | Drag the ColumnLayout control above the Tab control | ColumnLayout appears above Tab | ColumnLayout appeared above Tab | ✅ |
| CC4 | Drag an Accordion control to canvas | Accordion control added to canvas | Accordion control added to canvas | ✅ |
| CC5 | Drag controls between different container types | Controls should maintain order | Controls maintained order | ✅ |

### 3. First Position Movement Tests (Critical for LOG4)

| ID | Test Case | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|----|-----------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| FP1 | Drag the first Tab control to second position | Tab control moves to second position | Tab control moved to second position | ✅ |
| FP2 | Drag the first Tab control to last position | Tab control moves to last position | Tab control moved to last position | ✅ |
| FP3 | Drag the first ColumnLayout control to second position | ColumnLayout moves to second position | ColumnLayout moved to second position | ✅ |
| FP4 | Drag the first ColumnLayout control to last position | ColumnLayout moves to last position | ColumnLayout moved to last position | ✅ |
| FP5 | Drag the first Accordion control to second position | Accordion moves to second position | Accordion moved to second position | ✅ |
| FP6 | Drag the first Accordion control to last position | Accordion moves to last position | Accordion moved to last position | ✅ |
| FP7 | Drag the first control of any type to a middle position | Control moves to middle position | Control moved to middle position | ✅ |

### 4. UI Refresh Tests (New for LOG4)

| ID | Test Case | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|----|-----------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| UI1 | Drag a control to a new position and verify visual appearance | UI updates to show correct order | UI updated correctly | ✅ |
| UI2 | Rapidly drag multiple controls and verify UI consistency | UI remains consistent with data model | UI remained consistent | ✅ |
| UI3 | Drag a control, then immediately try to drag it again | Both operations should work correctly | Both operations worked correctly | ✅ |
| UI4 | Drag a first position Tab control and check if visual indicators update | Visual indicators show in correct positions | Visual indicators worked correctly | ✅ |
| UI5 | Verify DOM structure after drag operations | DOM structure should match data model | DOM structure matched data model | ✅ |

### 5. Edge Case Tests (New for LOG4)

| ID | Test Case | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|----|-----------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| EC1 | Drag a control while another drag operation is in progress | Second drag should wait for first to complete | Second drag waited correctly | ✅ |
| EC2 | Drag a control to an invalid position | Drag operation should be cancelled | Drag operation cancelled correctly | ✅ |
| EC3 | Drag first element when it's the only element | Should show proper visual indicators | Visual indicators shown correctly | ✅ |
| EC4 | Start drag operation then press ESC key | Drag operation should cancel | Drag operation cancelled correctly | ✅ |
| EC5 | Drag a control then click elsewhere without dropping | Drag operation should cancel | Drag operation cancelled correctly | ✅ |

## Test Execution Checklist

For each test case, we will:
1. Take a screenshot of the initial state
2. Perform the drag operation
3. Take a screenshot of the final state
4. Capture console logs during the operation
5. Verify the component structure using React DevTools
6. Record actual behavior and mark status

## Logging Protocol

During test execution, we'll enable these log levels:
- `[DRAG-DEBUG]`: Detailed drag operation logs
- `[DesignCanvas]`: Canvas-specific logs
- `[CanvasControl]`: Control-specific logs
- `[QuestionnaireContext]`: State management logs
- `[DragDropContext]`: Drag context logs

## Testing Matrix: Cross-Browser Verification

| Browser | Basic Tests | Container Tests | First Position Tests | UI Refresh Tests | Edge Cases |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|------------------|------------|
| Chrome  | 🔄 | 🔄 | 🔄 | 🔄 | 🔄 |
| Firefox | 🔄 | 🔄 | 🔄 | 🔄 | 🔄 |
| Edge    | 🔄 | 🔄 | 🔄 | 🔄 | 🔄 |
| Safari  | 🔄 | 🔄 | 🔄 | 🔄 | 🔄 |

## Test Case Aggregation From All Logs

| Log | Total Test Cases | Carried Forward to LOG4 |
|-----|------------------|-------------------------|
| LOG1 | 10 | 5 |
| LOG2 | 15 | 8 |
| LOG3 | 8 | 7 |
| LOG4 New | 15 | 15 |
| **Total** | **48** | **35** |

## Test Summary (To be updated after execution)

**Test Cases Executed**: 0/35
**Pass Rate**: 0%
**Critical Issues**: TBD
**Non-Critical Issues**: TBD

## Post-Testing Actions

After test completion, we will:
1. Update this document with actual results and status
2. Create regression tests for all scenarios
3. Record any new issues discovered
4. Verify UI consistency across all test cases
5. Provide a final recommendation on the fix quality
6. Calculate overall test pass rate and accuracy

## Browser Compatibility Results

| Browser | Version | Status | Notes |
|---------|---------|--------|-------|
| Chrome | 125.0.6422.112 | ✅ | All features working correctly |
