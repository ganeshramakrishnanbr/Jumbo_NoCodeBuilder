- **Expected Result**: Parent control should move with all child controls intact
- **Status**: PASS/FAIL
- **Notes**: [Add observations here]

#### Test 4.2: Moving a parent control to its own position

- **Status**: PASS/FAIL
- **Notes**: [Add observations here]

## Performance Considerations

- Monitor for any performance issues when dragging large parent controls
- Check for any UI lag or rendering issues during drag operations
- Verify that the application remains responsive after multiple drag-and-drop operations

## Visual Feedback

- Verify that appropriate visual feedback is shown during drag operations
- Confirm that the drop target indicators are clearly visible
- Check that the UI properly updates after the drag operation is complete
