# User Guide: Drag-and-Drop for Parent Controls

## Overview

The questionnaire designer now supports full drag-and-drop functionality for all control types, including parent controls (Tab, Accordion, and ColumnLayout). This guide explains how to use this enhanced functionality.

## What Has Changed?

Previously, you could add parent controls to your questionnaire but couldn't rearrange them after the initial placement. With this update, you can now:

- Move parent controls to any position in your questionnaire
- Reorder parent controls relative to other controls
- Drag parent controls between other parent controls
- Maintain all child controls and their structure during movement

## How to Use Parent Control Drag-and-Drop

### Moving a Tab Control

1. Hover over the Tab control you want to move
2. Click and hold on the move icon (↕️) in the top-left corner of the control
3. Drag to the desired position in your questionnaire
4. Release to drop the Tab control in its new position

All tabs, tab settings, and contained controls will be preserved during the move operation.

### Moving an Accordion Control

1. Hover over the Accordion control you want to move
2. Click and hold on the move icon (↕️) in the top-left corner of the control
3. Drag to the desired position in your questionnaire
4. Release to drop the Accordion control in its new position

All sections, expansion states, and contained controls will be preserved during the move operation.

### Moving a ColumnLayout Control

1. Hover over the ColumnLayout control you want to move
2. Click and hold on the move icon (↕️) in the top-left corner of the control
3. Drag to the desired position in your questionnaire
4. Release to drop the ColumnLayout control in its new position

All columns, column ratios, and contained controls will be preserved during the move operation.

## Visual Indicators

When dragging a parent control, you'll notice:

- The control becomes semi-transparent to indicate it's being dragged
- Blue horizontal lines appear to show where the control will be placed
- The target location is highlighted as you drag over different positions
- A blue border appears around valid drop zones

## Tips for Effective Drag-and-Drop

1. **Plan Your Layout**: Before adding many controls, plan your overall layout structure
2. **Use Keyboard Shortcuts**: Hold Shift while dragging to restrict movement to vertical only
3. **Watch for Visual Indicators**: Blue lines indicate where your control will be placed
4. **Drag Handle**: Always use the dedicated drag handle (↕️) for more precise control
5. **Undo Available**: If you drop a control in the wrong position, use Ctrl+Z (Cmd+Z on Mac) to undo

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Control doesn't move when dragging
**Solution**: Make sure you're dragging using the move icon (↕️) in the top-left corner

**Issue**: Control disappears after dropping
**Solution**: Check the bottom of your questionnaire; it may have been placed at the end. Use Ctrl+Z to undo.

**Issue**: Control content changed after moving
**Solution**: This shouldn't happen, but if it does, use Ctrl+Z to undo and try again with a slower drag movement.
