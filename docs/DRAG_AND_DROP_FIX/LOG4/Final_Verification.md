# Final Verification Report - Drag-and-Drop Framework Fix

## Fix Verification
**Date:** May 20, 2025  
**Tester:** Technical Lead  
**Build Version:** 0.1.4 (Build 126)

## Runtime Error Fix Verification

### Error Description
Prior to the fix, the following error occurred in the browser console when attempting to drag controls:
```
Uncaught ReferenceError: questionnaire is not defined
    at handleDragStart (CanvasControl.tsx:83)
```

This occurred specifically when accessing `questionnaire.controls` in the `handleDragStart` function of the `CanvasControl` component, because `questionnaire` was not included in the destructured values from the `useQuestionnaire` hook.

### Fix Implementation
The fix was implemented by updating the destructuring assignment in the `CanvasControl` component to include the `questionnaire` object:

```typescript
// Before:
const { updateControl, deleteControl, selectedControlId, setSelectedControlId, moveControl } = useQuestionnaire();

// After:
const { updateControl, deleteControl, selectedControlId, setSelectedControlId, moveControl, questionnaire } = useQuestionnaire();
```

### Verification Tests

| Test ID | Description | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| VF1 | Drag a control from the palette to the canvas | No console errors, control added successfully | No errors, control added successfully | ✅ |
| VF2 | Drag an existing control to a new position | No console errors, control moved successfully | No errors, control moved successfully | ✅ |
| VF3 | Drag a control from first position | No console errors, control moved successfully | No errors, control moved successfully | ✅ |
| VF4 | Drag a control to a container (Tab, Accordion, Column) | No console errors, control moved successfully | No errors, control moved successfully | ✅ |
| VF5 | Drag a control within a container to a new position | No console errors, control moved successfully | No errors, control moved successfully | ✅ |

### Browser Compatibility

| Browser | Version | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Chrome | 125.0.6422.112 | ✅ |
| Firefox | 122.0 | ✅ |
| Edge | 124.0.2478.80 | ✅ |
| Safari | 17.4.1 | ✅ |

## Additional Observations
- No performance impact was observed from the fix
- No regression issues were found in related functionality
- The fix did not affect the UI or user experience beyond resolving the error
- Console is now clean of all drag-related errors

## Conclusion
The fix for the "questionnaire is not defined" runtime error has been successfully implemented and verified. The error no longer occurs in any tested scenario, and the drag-and-drop functionality now works as expected across all supported browsers.

This completes the LOG4 drag-and-drop framework fixes, addressing all known issues with the feature.
