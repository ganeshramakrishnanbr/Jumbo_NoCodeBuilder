# Container Control - Drag & Drop and Property Access Framework

## CONTEXT
**System**: UI Designer/Builder application with container controls supporting nested child components

**Existing Components**:
- Tab control (container with tabbed sections for child controls)
- Accordion control (expandable/collapsible container for child controls)
- Column layout control (multi-column container for child controls)
- Design Tab (editing/configuration interface)
- Drag-and-drop system for control placement
- Properties panel (displays control-specific configurations)
- Control ordering/precedence system

**Current Architecture Issues**:
- Child controls within container controls cannot be reordered via drag-and-drop
- Properties panel does not display when child controls within containers are selected
- Container control selection takes precedence over child control selection
- Drag-and-drop system doesn't properly handle nested control hierarchies

**Requirements**: 
- Enable drag-and-drop reordering of child controls within all container types
- Allow property panel access for child controls within containers
- Maintain container control functionality while enabling child control manipulation
- Preserve existing drag-and-drop behavior for non-container controls

## TASK
Implement comprehensive drag-and-drop functionality and property access for child controls within container controls (Tab, Accordion, Column layout). Ensure users can:

1. **Reorder child controls** within container controls using drag-and-drop
2. **Access properties** of child controls by clicking on them within containers
3. **Maintain visual feedback** during drag-and-drop operations within containers
4. **Preserve container integrity** while manipulating child controls
5. **Support nested containers** (containers within containers)

**Specific Objectives**:
- Fix drag-and-drop event handling for nested controls
- Implement proper event delegation for child control selection
- Update properties panel to handle container-nested controls
- Add visual indicators for valid drop zones within containers
- Ensure consistent behavior across all container types

## CONSTRAINTS
- **Performance**: Drag operations should be smooth with minimal lag (<16ms response time)
- **User Experience**: Clear visual feedback during drag operations, intuitive selection behavior
- **Data Integrity**: Preserve control relationships and container structure during reordering
- **Compatibility**: Must work with existing container implementations and control types
- **Accessibility**: Maintain keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Browser Support**: Consistent behavior across all supported browsers
- **Memory**: Efficient event handling without memory leaks during frequent drag operations

## OUTPUT

### **Primary Deliverables**:
1. **Child Control Reordering**: Drag-and-drop functionality to change order within Tab controls
2. **Tab Child Properties Access**: Click selection of child controls displays their properties
3. **Accordion Child Reordering**: Drag-and-drop functionality to change order within Accordion controls
4. **Accordion Child Properties Access**: Click selection of child controls displays their properties
5. **Column Layout Child Reordering**: Drag-and-drop functionality to change order within Column layout controls
6. **Column Layout Child Properties Access**: Click selection of child controls displays their properties
7. **Preview Tab Rendering**: All container controls and their child controls render properly in Preview tab without issues
8. **Visual Drop Indicators**: Clear visual feedback showing valid drop zones within containers
9. **Event Delegation System**: Proper event handling for nested control interactions
10. **Selection Priority Logic**: Smart selection that distinguishes between container and child control clicks
11. **Cross-Container Consistency**: Uniform behavior across all container control types
12. **Nested Container Support**: Ability to manipulate controls within containers that are inside other containers

### **Technical Implementation Outputs**:
12. **Enhanced Event System**: Updated event delegation for container-child interactions
13. **Drop Zone Management**: Dynamic drop zone calculation within container boundaries
14. **Selection State Management**: Proper state handling for container vs child control selection
15. **Drag Preview System**: Visual representation of controls being dragged within containers
16. **Property Panel Integration**: Seamless property access for deeply nested controls
17. **Container Boundary Detection**: Logic to prevent invalid drops outside container areas

### **Testing & Quality Assurance**:
18. **Drag & Drop Tests**: Comprehensive testing for all reordering scenarios
19. **Property Access Tests**: Verification of property panel functionality for nested controls
20. **Cross-Browser Tests**: Compatibility testing across supported browsers
21. **Performance Tests**: Ensure smooth drag operations under various load conditions
22. **Accessibility Tests**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
23. **Regression Tests**: Verify existing functionality remains intact

### **Documentation & Support**:
24. **User Guide**: Instructions for using drag-and-drop within containers
25. **Developer Documentation**: Technical implementation details for container controls
26. **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions for nested control interactions
27. **API Documentation**: Updated specifications for container control methods

### **Review Section**:
**Quality Assurance Checklist**:
- [ ] Child controls can be reordered within Tab controls via drag-and-drop
- [ ] Child controls within Tab controls show properties when selected
- [ ] Child controls can be reordered within Accordion controls via drag-and-drop
- [ ] Child controls within Accordion controls show properties when selected
- [ ] Child controls can be reordered within Column layout controls via drag-and-drop
- [ ] Child controls within Column layout controls show properties when selected
- [ ] Visual indicators clearly show valid drop zones during drag operations
- [ ] Container controls still respond appropriately to direct selection
- [ ] Nested containers (containers within containers) work correctly
- [ ] Performance remains smooth during complex drag operations
- [ ] No memory leaks during repeated drag-and-drop operations
- [ ] Keyboard accessibility maintained for all interactions
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility preserved
- [ ] Cross-browser consistency verified
- [ ] All existing control functionality preserved (regression testing)

## IMPORTANT NOTES

**File Modification Scope**: Implementation should focus on core drag-and-drop and event handling systems. Modify only:
- Container control implementations (Tab, Accordion, Column layout)
- Drag-and-drop event system
- Properties panel selection logic
- Event delegation utilities

**Avoid Changes To**:
- Individual control implementations (unless for container integration)
- Core application framework
- Unrelated UI components
- Global configuration files outside of drag-and-drop scope

**Impact Limitation**: Changes should be contained within the drag-and-drop and container control ecosystem to minimize risk of breaking existing functionality.

## Success Metrics

- **Functional**: 100% success rate for child control reordering within all container types
- **User Experience**: Intuitive drag-and-drop with clear visual feedback, sub-200ms response time
- **Property Access**: Immediate property panel display when child controls are selected
- **Performance**: Smooth drag operations with no perceptible lag during complex interactions
- **Reliability**: Zero data loss or corruption during reordering operations
- **Compatibility**: Consistent behavior across all supported browsers and container combinations
- **Maintainability**: Clean separation of container and child control event handling logic
