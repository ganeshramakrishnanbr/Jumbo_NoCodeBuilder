## Feature Idea 1: User Authentication and Authorization

**Description:**
Implement a system for user registration, login, and session management. This would allow users to create accounts, save their questionnaires to their accounts, and manage access. Authorization rules could be added to control which users can access or modify specific questionnaires, potentially enabling collaboration features in the future.

**Rationale:**
- **Data Persistence & Security:** Currently, questionnaires might be saved in local storage or a shared backend without clear ownership. User accounts would secure user data and associate questionnaires with specific creators.
- **Foundation for Collaboration:** User accounts are a prerequisite for features like shared editing or team-based questionnaire management.
- **Personalization:** Could allow for user-specific settings or dashboards.
- **Enterprise Requirement:** Aligns with the "enterprise-grade" description of the application, as most enterprise software requires user authentication.

**Potential Implementation Considerations:**
- **User Model:** Define a user schema (e.g., in MongoDB) including fields like username, email, hashed password, etc.
- **Backend Routes:** Create API endpoints (e.g., using Express) for user registration, login, logout, and potentially profile management.
- **Authentication Strategy:** Implement token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) or session-based authentication.
- **Frontend Integration:** Update the UI to include login/registration forms, user profile sections, and conditionally render content based on authentication status.
- **Protecting Routes:** Secure backend API routes related to questionnaire creation, modification, and deletion to ensure only authenticated (and authorized) users can access them.
- **Password Management:** Implement secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt) and consider features like password reset.

## Feature Idea 2: Advanced Conditional Logic for Questions

**Description:**
Enable questionnaire designers to define rules that dynamically alter the questionnaire's behavior based on user responses. This could include:
- **Showing/Hiding Questions:** Display or conceal specific questions or sections based on answers to previous questions.
- **Making Questions Required/Optional:** Change the validation status of a question.
- **Jumping to Sections:** Direct users to different parts of the questionnaire based on their input.
- **Setting Question Values:** Pre-fill or modify answers to certain questions based on other answers.

**Rationale:**
- **Personalized Experience:** Tailor the questionnaire flow to each respondent, making it more relevant and potentially shorter.
- **Improved Data Quality:** Guide users to answer only relevant questions, reducing confusion and incomplete responses.
- **Sophisticated Forms:** Allows for the creation of more complex and intelligent forms that can adapt to various scenarios, fulfilling the "sophisticated, dynamic forms" promise.
- **Reduced Redundancy:** Avoid asking unnecessary questions.

**Potential Implementation Considerations:**
- **Rule Builder UI:** Design an intuitive interface within the questionnaire designer for creating and managing conditional rules. This might involve selecting a trigger question, an operator (e.g., "equals", "contains", "is greater than"), a value, and then defining the action (e.g., "show question X", "require question Y").
- **Rule Storage:** Determine how to store these rules within the questionnaire's JSON structure. This would likely involve adding a new property to question objects or a dedicated section in the questionnaire schema for logic.
- **Logic Engine:** Develop or integrate a JavaScript-based logic engine that can evaluate these rules in real-time as the user fills out the questionnaire.
- **Dependency Tracking:** Manage dependencies between questions to ensure that changes propagate correctly and to avoid circular logic.
- **UI Updates:** Ensure the frontend dynamically re-renders the questionnaire based on the evaluated logic.
- **Performance:** For complex questionnaires with many rules, ensure the logic evaluation does not negatively impact performance.

## Feature Idea 3: Versioning and Revision History for Questionnaires

**Description:**
Implement a system that allows users to save different versions of their questionnaires and view a history of changes. Users should be able to:
- **Save a New Version:** Manually create a named version of the current questionnaire design.
- **Automatic Versioning (Optional):** Potentially create automatic versions or snapshots at regular intervals or after significant changes.
- **View Revision History:** See a list of past versions with timestamps and user information (if authentication is implemented).
- **Preview Past Versions:** View a read-only representation of a previous version.
- **Revert to a Past Version:** Restore the questionnaire design to a selected previous version.

**Rationale:**
- **Design Safety Net:** Protects against accidental data loss or unwanted changes by allowing designers to roll back to a known good state.
- **Audit Trail:** Provides a history of how the questionnaire has evolved, which can be useful for compliance or understanding design decisions.
- **Experimentation:** Enables designers to experiment with different layouts or questions without fear of losing their current work. They can save a version before making major changes.
- **Collaboration (Future):** If collaboration features are added, versioning becomes even more critical to track who changed what and when.

**Potential Implementation Considerations:**
- **Storage Strategy:**
    - **Full Snapshots:** Store a complete JSON copy of the questionnaire for each version. Simpler to implement but can consume more storage.
    - **Diff-based:** Store only the differences (deltas) between versions. More storage-efficient but more complex to implement and reconstruct versions.
- **Version Metadata:** Store metadata for each version, such as version number/ID, timestamp, user who saved it (if applicable), and an optional user-provided description or name for the version.
- **Database Integration:** This feature would likely require database support (e.g., MongoDB) to store the versions and their metadata. A separate collection could be used to store questionnaire versions, linked to the main questionnaire document.
- **User Interface:**
    - Add UI elements in the designer to save a new version.
    - Create a new view or modal to display the revision history.
    - Provide options to preview or revert to a selected version.
- **Impact on Existing Save/Load Logic:** The current save/load mechanisms (`api.ts`) would need to be updated to handle versions. When loading a questionnaire, it should load the latest version by default.
- **Branching (Advanced):** For very advanced scenarios, consider if branching (similar to Git) would be useful, allowing different design paths to be explored simultaneously. This is likely overkill for most questionnaire tools but could be a long-term consideration.
