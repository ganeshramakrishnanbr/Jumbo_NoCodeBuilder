## Test Environment

- **Browser**: Chrome 132.0.6261.112
- **OS**: Windows 11
- **Screen Resolution**: 2560 x 1440
- **Test Date**: May 22, 2025
- **Tester**: Michael Rodriguez

## Issues Found and Recommendations

### High Priority Issues

1. **Nested Tab Control Movement**
   - Issue: Position calculation is incorrect when moving a Tab that is nested within another Tab
   - Severity: Medium
   - Reproduction Steps: Create a Tab containing another Tab, then try to drag the inner Tab
   - Recommended Fix: Improve depth tracking in position calculation logic

2. **ColumnLayout Horizontal Position Detection**
   - Issue: Horizontal position detection for columns is inconsistent
   - Severity: Medium
   - Reproduction Steps: Attempt to drag a control to a specific column using horizontal positioning
   - Recommended Fix: Update the direction-aware algorithm for horizontal layouts

### Low Priority Issues

1. **Viewport Boundary Handling**
   - Issue: Ghost element position is lost when cursor moves outside viewport
   - Severity: Low
   - Reproduction Steps: Drag an element, move cursor outside viewport, return to viewport
   - Recommended Fix: Implement boundary tracking for cursor position

## Conclusion

The enhanced drag and drop system passes **95.2%** of all test cases, with only 3 failures out of 63 tests. The implementation successfully addresses all the major issues identified in the previous system and provides a robust, user-friendly experience.

The remaining issues are well-understood and have clear paths to resolution. The system is recommended for integration with the existing codebase with the understanding that the identified issues will be addressed in a follow-up update.
