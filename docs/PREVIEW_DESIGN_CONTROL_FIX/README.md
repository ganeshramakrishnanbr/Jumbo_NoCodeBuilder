# PREVIEW DESIGN CONTROL FIX

## Overview
This folder contains comprehensive documentation of the fixes implemented to address control rendering issues in both the Properties Panel and Preview mode of the Questionnaire Designer. 

Two major issues were addressed:

1. **Parent Control Properties Display**: Fixed parent controls (Tab, Accordion, ColumnLayout) not displaying their properties in the Properties Panel when selected.

2. **Numeric Control Preview Rendering**: Fixed numeric controls not displaying properly in the Preview tab, ensuring labels, input fields, and validation ranges are visible.

## Issue Summary

Two key issues were addressed:

1. **Parent Controls Properties Issue**: Parent controls (Tab, Accordion, ColumnLayout) were not displaying their properties in the Properties Panel when selected, showing "Select a control to edit its properties" instead.

2. **Numeric Control Preview Issue**: Numeric controls were not rendering correctly in the Preview tab, failing to show the label, input field, and validation range information.

The root causes were identified as:
1. Missing handling for Accordion controls in the `flattenControls` function
2. Incorrect property access for ColumnLayout controls (using `columns` as an array when it's a number)
3. Missing rendering implementation for the numeric control type in the Preview tab

## Fix Summary

The implementation:
1. Updated the `flattenControls` function in `PropertiesPanel.tsx` to correctly handle all parent control types
2. Fixed property access for ColumnLayout controls to use the correct `columnControls` property
3. Added a proper `renderNumeric` function to the `PreviewTab.tsx` file
4. Updated the `renderControl` switch statement to handle numeric controls properly
5. Added additional type checking to prevent runtime errors

## Version Information
