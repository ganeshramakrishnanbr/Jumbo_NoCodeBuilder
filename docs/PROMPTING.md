## Accordion Section Enhancement [2024-03-22 11:30:00]
**User**: Issue is still not resolved. The user is not able to add section in the Accordion control in the design tab. The add section menu shouldn't be visible in the preview tab.

**Response**: Fixed the accordion control functionality:
1. Enhanced AccordionProperties component with section management
2. Added section limit validation (max 3 sections)
3. Improved section management UI with visual feedback
4. Updated drag and drop support for sections
5. Fixed preview tab to hide section management controls
