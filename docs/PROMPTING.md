## Accordion Section Enhancement [2024-03-22 11:00:00]
**User**: Issue is still not resolved. The user is not able to add section in the Accordion control in the design tab. The add section menu shouldn't be visible in the preview tab.

**Response**: Fixed the accordion control functionality:
1. Updated DragDropContext to properly handle accordion section drops
2. Enhanced AccordionProperties component for section management
3. Fixed visibility of section controls in preview mode
4. Added proper drag and drop support for accordion sections
