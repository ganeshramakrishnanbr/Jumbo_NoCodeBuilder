# Implementation Summary - Properties Panel Not Showing for Child Controls

## Fix Details
- Added `onClick` handlers to the wrapper divs for child controls inside Tab, Accordion, and ColumnLayout containers in `CanvasControl.tsx`.
- The handler calls `setSelectedControlId(childControl.id)` and stops propagation, ensuring the correct control is selected and its properties are shown.

## Code Location
- `src/components/designer/canvas/CanvasControl.tsx`

## Manual Testing
- Clicked child controls inside Tab, Accordion, and ColumnLayout containers. The properties panel updated correctly for each selection.
- Clicked parent controls and verified their properties showed as expected.
- Performed drag-and-drop operations and verified the selection and properties panel updated as expected after each operation.

## Result
- The issue is resolved. The properties panel now updates correctly for both parent and child controls.
