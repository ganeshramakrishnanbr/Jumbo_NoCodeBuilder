# User Guide: Properties Panel for Child Controls

## Overview
After this fix, you can now select any child control inside Tab, Accordion, or ColumnLayout containers and immediately see and edit its properties in the properties panel.

## How to Use
1. **Select a Child Control:**
   - Click on any control inside a Tab, Accordion section, or ColumnLayout column.
   - The properties panel on the right will update to show the selected control's properties.
2. **Select a Parent Control:**
   - Click on the border or header of a Tab, Accordion, or ColumnLayout to select the parent container and view its properties.
3. **Drag and Drop:**
   - After moving controls, click any control to view and edit its properties as usual.

## Tips
- If you cannot see the properties for a control, ensure you are clicking directly on the control (not just the container background).
- The selection ring (blue border) indicates which control is currently selected.
